## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A power tool developers can use to pack up code to reuse throughout a program and to code dynamic.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  It starts with a function declaration and a name. followed by parenthesis () and a pair of curly braces {} to wrap the code of text the function is going to execute.
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  To call a function, type the function name and parenthesis ()
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  Calling a function is just a line of code stating the name and parenthesis with or without a passed in argument, while the definition defines what line of code the function will execute when called.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter is a placeholder for an argument to be passed into when calling the function.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Function parameters are useful so you can see what and how many arguments can be passed into the function when called.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  The return statement kicks us out of our loop and cause the function to produce a value we can use in our program.
