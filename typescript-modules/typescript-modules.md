## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are modules?
  Components and sub-components broken down into multiple files.
- What is the difference between named and default imports?
  Named imports can be called just like any other component.
  Default imports have to be defined for each component to be called.
- What is the difference between named and default exports?
  Default exports allow you to give any name you want to the module being imported.
  Named Exports all have their own unique names which is better for code clarity because it is consistent and makes it easier for TS to assist with typing.
