## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are objects used for?
  To store different types of data, a collection of data
- What are object properties?
  Object properties are named key: value pairs.
- Describe object literal notation.
  The object literal notation ({..}) stores key: value pairs within the object.
- How do you remove a property from an object?
  A property can be removed with the delete operator (delete.objectName(property)).
- What are the two ways to get or update the value of a property?
  To access the value of a property, both dot or bracket notation can be used.
  Bracket notation has the advantage here because it can access keys with a string as a name, dot notation would cause a syntax error.
- What is the purpose of interfaces in TypeScript?
  Interfaces are used in a similar way to labeling variables in TypeScript.
  Instead of passing one object into the console, we can pass any object that meets the listed required properties.
- How do optional properties in a TypeScript interface differ from mandatory properties, and why are they useful?
  Optional properties makes it so that any object that contains at least one of the properties listed can be called, while ignoring the other values.
