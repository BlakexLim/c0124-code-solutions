# final-project-scope-of-work

## Questions

1. What aspects of the project are still incomplete?

2. What challenges are you currently facing in your project? What are some specific areas that still need to be investigated?

3. What is your plan to try to overcome these challenges? What resources can you use?

## Write Up

<!--- Final project write up goes here --->

1. Some stretch features I would like to add are online/local multiplayer, map variety, more sophisticated AI to generate the bullets on screen and focus the player
2. Current challenges would be having unique usernames for users, as of now multiple accounts can be created using the same credentials and that can mess with a user's progress. I am having a bit of a hard time figuring this out, but I sort of have the logic, I just need to figure out how and where to write the code.
3. I plan on doing a deeper dive and see what other people are doing to solve this issue and even asking my classmates because I'm sure they've encountered this, or even work with them to figure it out if they haven't. TA's are also an option
